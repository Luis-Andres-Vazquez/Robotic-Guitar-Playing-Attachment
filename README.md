# Robotic-Guitar-Playing-Attachment

This project consists of two code files (one written in python3 and the other in c++). The first being the python one, translates chord songs into motor positions and compiles it in a text file. This text file is then uploaded to a microSD card that.
The second is the c++ code uploaded on an Arduino Mega 2560 which reads the text file from the microSD card and instructs the actuators what to do in order to play the chords of an entire song.
